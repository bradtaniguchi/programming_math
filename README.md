ex: the probability of two or more people sharing a birthday

This program shows the amount of people in a classroom it takes to certainly have a birthdate shared. The lefts side will show the day decreased and the right side will show the current probability of that day.  When we find a day that arrives at a probability below a probability we want we stop.  The program keeps track then of how many people were needed and subtracts from 1 the last probability it arrived at.  Then it will give the answer.
